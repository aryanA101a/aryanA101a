# Hi, I am Aryan Arora ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I love to work on low-level engineering and backend development, building high-performance systems from the ground up. Whether it's designing a compression tool, optimizing an API, or developing an emulator, I enjoy breaking down complex problems and pushing technical limits. Always up for a challenge.

Right now I am working at Viscommerce as a Software Engineer

### Skills
A quick look at my pinned projects and open-source contributions will give you a good enough picture of my expertise.
I'll say I am as malleable as silver when it comes to hopping on to new tech, but that doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t have strong opinions.
