### About Me
Hey! I'm Aryan, a passionate CS student with an insatiable curiosity for exploring everything this field
has to offer. I'm mostly at home with **Android development** and I like tinkering around with **systems applications** and **low-level programming**.

Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges to push my limits and expand my horizons. Thereâ€™s something magical about diving deep into the inner workings of a computer and seeing how everything comes together to create the amazing applications we use every day.
